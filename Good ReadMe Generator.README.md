## Description
This project allows users like myself and other programmers to generate professional ReadMes for their repos.

## Installation
Inquirer needs to be installed and fs needs to be set as a requirement. 

## Usage
This ReadMe generator will be used to generate ReadMe files with a unique name, clickable links, a functional table of contents and a license badge.

## Contributing 
I would like to thank GitHub for having useful documentation on license badges/ links. 

## Tests
I tested out the Readme generator mulitple times, making sure the layout looked how I desired and that everything that was meant to be clickable- was.
